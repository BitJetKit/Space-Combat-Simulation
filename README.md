# Space-Combat-Simulation
Android game for a college project. A top-down 2D space shooter with Newtonian physics and mesmerizing visuals, where skilfully handling one's own vessel by managing thrusters for free movement in all directions through an on-screen joystick and phone tilt for turning plays a crucial role in surviving the deadly arena. Each level provides a unique combat ground with different threats, while a rich spacecraft selection with about dozen parameters per ship will suite a wide range of playstyles.
